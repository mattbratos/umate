# UMate Project README

## ðŸš€ About UMate

I couldn't stand using terrible university software from 20 years ago. To navigate our uni, we had to use 13 different apps, and every one of them was unusable. So, I decided to create one "Student Life OS". I also think it's a terrible waste that universities don't collect vast amounts of data about student satisfaction, engagement, and all sorts of very valuable insights with their scale and financial capabilities.

## ðŸ¤“ What I've Learned

- **UX/UI Design**:
  \_ I've completed Google UX/UI bootcamp to learn design
- Wirefreams, prototyping and mockups
- **Product Management**:
  \_ For the first time I lead team of 5 people and could put into practive my skills from Google Project Management Bootcamp
- **Scrum**:
  \_ I lead first scrum team, scrum ceremonies and managed project backlog.
- **Design Sprint Methodology**:
  \_ Lead first design sprint, and tought this methogology to 4 other team memebers
- ** Pitching**:
- During this project I piched it probably more then 100 times to different people in very different curciomstainses (from an offical event to a house party) it really teached me what to focus on and how to get buy in from differen stakeholders, and made my relly enjoy public speaking

## ðŸ’¡ Lessons Learned

- Academia is extremely overpriced, doesn't care about its users, and focuses mainly on marketing and acquiring new students, while their current users are extremely unhappy.
- Nobody in Generation Z values a university degree because the level is so low and everyone passes, so the diploma doesn't prove anything anymore.
- There is a shocking consensus among students that they won't learn anything useful at university and they are here only for the paper and credibility.
- Everyone learns actually useful things online because it's way easier, faster, and more customizable. So, skills are from the internet and credibility is from the university.
- It's just a matter of time when internet education will have greater credibility than academia.
- Every university on this planet is broken by design and unsuitable for modern times. Upgrading the curriculum, teaching methods, and lecture material once a year in the internet age is pathetic. This design did a great job and was the best we had 500 years ago, but in the internet age, it's a joke. If your iteration speed is 1 iteration/year while internet-based competition can do it 10k times a day, you have absolutely 0 chances of survival.
- Academia won't change because it doesn't care about it's users because they think they have a monopoly for education. They couldn't be more wrong. Evolve or die is the most acciomatis truth in the universe.
