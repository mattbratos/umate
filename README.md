## ðŸš€ About

I couldn't stand using terrible university software from 20 years ago. To navigate our uni, we had to use 13 different apps, and every one of them was unusable. So, I decided to create one "Student Life OS". I also think it's a terrible waste that universities don't collect vast amounts of data about student satisfaction, engagement, and all sorts of very valuable insights with their scale and financial capabilities.

## ðŸ¤“ What I've Learned

**UX/UI Design**:

- Completed Google's UX/UI bootcamp to learn design.
- Gained skills in wireframes, prototyping, and mockups.

**Product Management**:

- For the first time, led a team of 5 people and applied my skills from Google's Project Management Bootcamp.

**Scrum**:

- Led my first scrum team, facilitated scrum ceremonies, and managed the project backlog.

**Design Sprint Methodology**:

- Led my first design sprint and taught this methodology to 4 other team members.

**Pitching**:

- Pitched the project over 100 times to various audiences in very different circumstances (from an official event to a house party), which taught me how to focus on what's important to gain buy-in from different stakeholders and really made me enjoy public speaking.

5. **Meeting with University**: Very harsh rejection after 6 months of promissing support and post-poding a final meeting. Quote: "You are not getting this deal, don't send us anymore questions, don't ask for requiremnts and don't talk to us anymore, bye"

## ðŸ’¡ Lessons Learned

- Academia is extremely overpriced, doesn't care about its users, and focuses mainly on marketing and acquiring new students, while their current users are extremely unhappy.
- Nobody in Generation Z values a university degree because the level is so low and everyone passes, so the diploma doesn't prove anything anymore.
- There is a shocking consensus among students that they won't learn anything useful at university and they are here only for the paper and credibility.
- Everyone learns actually useful things online because it's way easier, faster, and more customizable. So, skills are from the internet and credibility is from the university.
- It's just a matter of time when internet education will have greater credibility than academia.
- Every university on this planet is broken by design and unsuitable for modern times. Upgrading the curriculum, teaching methods, and lecture material once a year in the internet age is pathetic. This design did a great job and was the best we had 500 years ago, but in the internet age, it's a joke. If your iteration speed is 1 iteration/year while internet-based competition can do it 10k times a day, you have absolutely 0 chances of survival.
- Academia won't change because it doesn't care about it's users because they think they have a monopoly for education. They couldn't be more wrong. Evolve or die is the most acciomatis truth in the universe.
